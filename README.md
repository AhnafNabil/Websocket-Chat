# Description of the Whole Task

## 1. main.go:

This file contains the server-side logic for the WebSocket chat application.

Key components:
a) Imports: It uses the "net/http" package for HTTP server functionality and "github.com/gorilla/websocket" for WebSocket support.

b) Global variables:
   - `upgrader`: Used to upgrade HTTP connections to WebSocket connections.
   - `clients`: A map to keep track of connected clients.
   - `broadcast`: A channel for sending messages to all clients.

c) Main function:
   - Sets up HTTP route handlers.
   - Starts a goroutine for handling messages.
   - Starts the HTTP server on port 8080.

d) handleHome function:
   - Serves the index.html file when a client accesses the root URL.

e) handleConnections function:
   - Upgrades the HTTP connection to a WebSocket connection.
   - Creates a new client and adds it to the clients map.
   - Listens for messages from the client and sends them to the broadcast channel.

f) handleMessages function:
   - Runs in a separate goroutine.
   - Continuously listens on the broadcast channel for new messages.
   - When a message is received, it sends it to all connected clients.

## 2. index.html:

This file contains the client-side interface and logic for the chat application.

Key components:
a) HTML structure:
   - An input field for entering messages.
   - A button to send messages.
   - A div to display the chat messages.

b) JavaScript:
   - Establishes a WebSocket connection to the server.
   - Sets up an onmessage event handler to display received messages.
   - Implements a sendMessage function to send messages to the server.

## The whole process

1. When you run the server (main.go), it starts listening for HTTP connections on port 8080.

2. When a client accesses http://localhost:8080, the server serves the index.html file.

3. The client's browser loads index.html and executes the JavaScript, which establishes a WebSocket connection back to the server.

4. The server upgrades this connection to a WebSocket connection and adds the client to its list of connected clients.

5. When a user types a message and clicks "Send":
   - The client-side JavaScript sends the message to the server via the WebSocket connection.
   - The server receives this message in the handleConnections function.
   - The message is then sent to the broadcast channel.

6. The handleMessages goroutine picks up the message from the broadcast channel and sends it to all connected clients.

7. Each client receives the message via their WebSocket connection, and the onmessage handler in the JavaScript displays the message in the chat div.

This process allows for real-time, bidirectional communication between the server and multiple clients, enabling instant messaging functionality. The server acts as a central hub, receiving messages from any client and broadcasting them to all connected clients.
